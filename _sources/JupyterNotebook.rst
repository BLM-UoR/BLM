Jupyter Notebook
================


The Jupyter Notebook is an ideal tool for exploratory data analysis,
by using which you can finish data processing, computation, plotting and
even writing (using Markdown) in one stop.
Also, it supports more programming languages than just Python: Julia, R, etc..
In this course, we will only use *Python* for its well developed ecosystem in
data science and scientific computing.

Below we only cover several key points for using Jupyter Notebooks

Jupyter Notebook Extensions
----------------------------------

In addition to the Jupyter Notebook itself,
we recommend Jupyter Notebook Extensions as well, which can further
enhance your productivity in the Jupyter Notebook environment.
A good guide can be found `here <https://towardsdatascience.com/jupyter-notebook-extensions-517fa69d2231>`__.

Among a variety of extensions, the following are considered essential and particularly
useful for this course, and many other data-analysis-oriented ones:

    #. Table of Contents: this extension helps building well-structured notebooks and allows easier navigation.

    #. Collapsible Headings: this tool further enhances the power of the above one by allowing collasible sections, particularly useful for large notebooks.

    #. ExecuteTime: this gadget reports the executation time of each cell so you can always have a measure of the code efficiency.

    #. Code prettify: this tool quickly formats your Python code with a pretty and tidy layout.

And we emphasise that **structuring your notebook** is the key.
`This post <https://towardsdatascience.com/set-your-jupyter-notebook-up-right-with-this-extension-24921838a332>`__ helps you
set up your Notebook with a good structure.
