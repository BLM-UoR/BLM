GitHub
======

.. This class adopts a git-based workflow to disseminate and collect
.. programming tasks using `GitHub`_ as platform.
.. By doing so, we expect students to develop their skills in
.. version control and collaboration with modern techniques, especially
.. for those programming-intensive tasks.

For those who are new to GitHub, here is a quick introduction by GitHub
themselves:

    "GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration.
    It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere."

A good tutorial for GitHub can be found `here <https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/>`__.
Also, we suggest students to go through more tutorials below to get familiar with git and GitHub:

    #. `Git Handbook`_: Learn about version controlâ€”in particular, Git, and how it works with GitHub.
    #. `GitHub-based workflow`_: This guide explains how and why GitHub flow works.

    the homework organisation.
