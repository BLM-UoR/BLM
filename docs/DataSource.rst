Data Sources
============

In this course, we focus on the :term:`AmeriFlux` datasets for analysis.
The :term:`URAO` dataset might also be used,
so some knowledge of both will be helpful.



Period selection
----------------

.. note::

   Raw observational data undergoing a large amount of processing prior to be used (e.g. calculation of fluxes using :ref:`EC` techniques). They are usually collected with preliminary, or even without, "cleaning".

   It is thus crucial to consider different aspects for different parameters:

   * cloud cover (e.g. this is important for the first plot)

   * vegetation state (e.g. are leaves on the trees?) (:ref:`LAI`)

   * wind direction (e.g. does land cover type vary with wind direction?)

   * Check that most of the data are available.

   * Look carefully at the turbulent heat fluxes,
     i.e. small numbers of 30 min periods can be missing
     â€“ that is ok
