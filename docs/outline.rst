Autumn 2019 Course Outline
====================================================================
**Boundary Layer Meteorology (MT37J/MT49E)**

.. _Team:

Instructors
-----------

-  Professor Sue Grimmond (c.s.grimmond@reading.ac.uk)
-  Dr Ting Sun (ting.sun@reading.ac.uk)
-  Dr Hamidreza Omidvar (h.omidvar@reading.ac.uk)
-  Dr Todd Jones (t.r.jones@reading.ac.uk)


Aim
--------

The aim is to achieve an in-depth understanding of the boundary layer.
By the end of the first half of the module you should be able to:

-  describe methods to observe the boundary layer and their limitations
-  use models to evaluate processes occurring within the boundary layer
-  understand the key features and results of surface layer similarity
   theory
-  analyse and synthesise observations from different instruments
-  collaborate with others under field-campaign and/or data analysis conditions
-  present results in conference presentation and
   `paper formats <ScientificPaper.rst>`__

Term 1 Course Outline

.. note::

    - Term 1 (first half of module): includes *lectures*, *practical sessions*,
      *tutorials* and *student presentations*.
    - For the first part of the term we will focus on
      `Assignment1 <Assignment1.rst>`__.
    - `Each week <BringToClass.rst>`_ you will need to bring to
      class some  completed material related to this.

Recommended Readings
--------------------

The `reading list <ReadingList.rst>`__ has useful textbooks that will be referred (plus others) to in class.
They can be useful for background, typical values and details of methods *etc*.
