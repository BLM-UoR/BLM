Assignment 2
============
Objective
-------------------------------------------

* To prepare a research paper on an approved topic related to boundary layer meteorology that uses observations and involves a range of programming skills for the data analysis.

Length
    2000 Words (this is the maximum limit; aim to be concise)
Paper  structure
    Use a structure similar to a full journal :ref:`Paper`. Do not forget to read through your paper and fix any `common mistakes <CommonMistakes.rst>`_



Projects Topics
---------------------------
The projects should draw on the URAO data and/or AmeriFlux (and/or other sites if appropriate). The goal is to undertake a more in depth analysis of some aspect of Boundary Layer Meteorology. It is most likely to be a more in-depth analysis of data analysed in Assignment 1 (e.g. longer time period, different analyses discussed in class, lecture notes) or using the models discussed in class, etc.

Potential projects (these are just some ideas, others will be mentioned in class, or discuss other ideas with me/us)

#. Evaluation of SUEWS/SuPy model or other models

    * Stability correction
    * Fluxes
    * Friction velocity
    * Surface resistance

#. Variability of turbulence characteristics with wind direction

    * Roughness length
    * Stability functions
    * Turbulent intensities

#. Variation of stability

    * By method of observation
    * With height
    * With time (day, year)

#. Carbon dioxide fluxes and their variability

    * Time of year
    * With stability

#. Ceilometers

    * Variation in cloud characteristics (height, cover)
    * Cloud and radiation relation
    * Atmospheric stability and boundary layer height
