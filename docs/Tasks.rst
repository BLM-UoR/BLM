Assignment 1 Activities
=========================

These are the various topics to be addressed in Assignment 1. A series of tasks in a logical calculation order are provided to help you understand the different physical properties and processes.

.. only:: latex

  The tasks are prepared in Jupyter notebooks and can be `viewed and executed online <https://blm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tasks.html>`_

.. note::

    #. When you write your paper, the presentation will be as a coherent scientific paper, not a set of individual tasks, not necessarily in this order and not including each of the individual components (e.g. `Week 1 plots <tasks/task1.ipynb>`_ are intended to get you going).

    #. These tasks are to be undertaken *in assigned groups* according to
       land cover types, but *independent papers* will be written (without plagarism).



.. MT49E Extra: Processing of EC measurements
.. ------------------------------------------

.. For one of the hours for which you have analysed EC data,
..    download the raw 10 Hz data (provide this data)

..    -  Calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes. You will need to
..       perform co-ordinate rotations.
..    -  Calculate the Obukhov length for the same period.
..    -  Compare your results to the pre-calculated heat fluxes (e.g. add
..       data points to your previous graphs).
..    -  Identify what corrections you have made to your calculations
..       compared with other possible corrections you could have used (e.g.
..       see Burba 2013; Kotthaus and Grimmond 2014). Consider the
..       implications of these.
