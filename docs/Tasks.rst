Activities
=========================

These activities are designed to be in a logical calculation order to help you understand different physical properties and processes.

.. only:: latex

  The tasks are prepared in Jupyter notebooks and can be `viewed and executed online <https://blm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Tasks.html>`_


.. only:: html

.. tip::

      The tasks designed here are based on Python 3. We recommend this software bundle (with download link):

      #. Anaconda 3: an easy-to-use Python 3 bundle with many preinstalled data analysis packages. `download  Anaconda 3 <https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/>`_

..      #. GitHub Desktop: the official git client by GitHub with essential git functionalities. `download GitHub Desktop <https://desktop.github.com>`_

.. .. note::

..    #. When you write your paper, the presentation will be as a coherent scientific paper, not a set of individual tasks, not necessarily in this order and not including each of the individual components (e.g. `Week 1 plots <tasks/task1.ipynb>`_ are intended to get you going).

..    #. These tasks are to be undertaken *in assigned groups* according to land cover types, but *independent papers* will be written (without plagarism).








.. MT49E Extra: Processing of EC measurements
.. ------------------------------------------

.. For one of the hours for which you have analysed EC data,
..    download the raw 10 Hz data (provide this data)

..    -  Calculate the sensible and latent heat fluxes. You will need to
..       perform co-ordinate rotations.
..    -  Calculate the Obukhov length for the same period.
..    -  Compare your results to the pre-calculated heat fluxes (e.g. add
..       data points to your previous graphs).
..    -  Identify what corrections you have made to your calculations
..       compared with other possible corrections you could have used (e.g.
..       see Burba 2013; Kotthaus and Grimmond 2014). Consider the
..       implications of these.
