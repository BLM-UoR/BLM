What are the effects of systematically perturbing $Q^*$, $Q_G$, canopy resistance $r_c$, roughness length $z_0$ in the Penman Monteith equation?\n1. Which uncertainty has the biggest effect on the estimated fluxes?\n1. Derive an overall estimate for the accuracy of the Penman-Monteith method for both $Q_E$ and $Q_H$. Do this by assuming reasonable errors in the parameters and variables.\n1. What is the impact of assuming neutral conditions versus actual stability conditions on the calculated value of $r_a$?\n1. What error in the fluxes does this cause?\n1. How will this error vary for extremely unstable or stable conditions?\n1. Cumulative totals:\n    -  Plot the ensemble median and the mean of the of $z^{'}/L$.\n    -  Describe how the energy partitioning varies through the day and with synoptic conditions.\n\n</div>\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### What to bring in the next class\n\nEach student: a short report on sensitivity analysis of PM-based $Q_E$"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Tasks: TODO"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"#### load necessary packages"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"#### load data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# code"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"#### examine data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":4,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# code and plot"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
