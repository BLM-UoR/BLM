Visit to Observatory
-----------------------------------------------------

Objective
  The purpose of this visit is to think about how instrumentation is deployed and its fetch.  See more details here: :ref:`URAO`

.. tip::
   #. Read :ref:`safety` information about visiting the URAO
   #. Read the Risk Assessment for visiting the Observatory (on `BB<https://www.bb.reading.ac.uk/bbcswebdav/pid-4623796-dt-content-rid-14266489_2/xid-14266489_2>`_).
   #. Sign the Risk Assessment for visiting the Observatory.

Activity in URAO
   #. Identify the **instrumentation** to directly measure all terms of the surface energy balance, radiation balance, temperatures, wind speed, wind direction, boundary layer height and/or cloud height and various land surface model parameters. What are the **instrument details**, including name, manufacturer, sample rate, averaging time, height, orientation (e.g. wind direction of sonic anemometer), other variables observed or derived by/from an instrument
   #. Look at the surroundings of the University of Reading Atmospheric Observatory (URAO). Identify in what **wind directions** will the sensors have different **fetch** (nature of upwind surface).

.. _after_visit:

Activity after URAO visit
   #. For **your site** in the `AmeriFlux network <DataSource.rst>`_, access key papers about your site to determine how the fluxes and other variables are observed. Create a summary table that includes:

      * Instrument details, including name, manufacturer, sample rate, averaging time, height, orientation (e.g. wind direction of sonic anemometer)
      * Photograph (*from web*) of the instruments (i.e. model,etc) you can work in teams to find these.
      * General method used to obtain the flux
   #. Using Google/Bing Maps (or other equivalent) to identify what upwind conditions are relative to the
      orientation of the instruments. Think carefully about which sensors this is critical for.

      -  Create an annotated figure for **your site** with sectors identified.
   #. **Prepare a document** that summarises the information above for the start of next class.

      -  The document should have figure and table captions (if you are
         unclear review the journal papers you are reading about your site).
      -  Note: A figure/table caption should be sufficient for a reader to interpret the material without reading the body of the text.
