The Penman Monteith equation assumes energy balance closure at each model time step (#TODO: add link to notes).\n2. Identify which parameter values were used initially.\n3. Use the calculated roughness length and the canopy resistances to calculate the PM fluxes (QH and QE) for the same period. What is the impact on the evaluation statistics?\n3. Evaporation bridges the surface water and energy balance. Convert your PM QE estimate and your EC QE estimate from $\\text{W m}^{-2}$ to evapotranspiration in $\\text{mm day}^{-1}$. Given that there has to be sufficient water available for that total evaporation in the period, over what period did that amount of rainfall occur (e.g. plot precipitation and rainfall)?\n\n</div>\n\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"### Tasks"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"#### load necessary packages"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"import numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom pathlib import Path\n"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"#### load data"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":2,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# code"},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{},"source":"#### Calculate $Q_E$ and $Q_H$ using Penman-Monteith"},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{},"outputs":[],"source":"# calculation and plot"}],"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":2,"metadata":{"language_info":{"name":"python","codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3}},"orig_nbformat":2,"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","npconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":3}}
