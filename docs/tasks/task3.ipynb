[Eddy Covariance](../EddyCovariance.rst) observations allow several important parameters to be determined:\n   -  **Zero plane displacement length** $d$ can be calculated based on vegetation height (think about changes in [LAI](../LAI.rst) and porosity). If there is a profile of anemometers (e.g. as at the [Observatory](Observatory.rst)) then this can be calculated using that.\n   -  **roughness length** $z_0$ can be calculated from the EC data ([EddyCovariance](../EddyCovariance.rst)) by rearranging the logarithmic law from the neutral wind profile [WindProfile](WindProfile.rst)).\n2.  Do these vary with season? Wind Direction? Create a graph to analyse the data (think about wind directions).\n3.  How do these values compare to the literature?\n1.  Calculate the **aerodynamic resistance** $r_a$.\n2.
