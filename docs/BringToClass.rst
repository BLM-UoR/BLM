#. [3] compare your albedo values to the literature
#. [4] demonstrate progress on calculating roughness length


.. _Week4:

#. Plot of albedo variation on both days
#. Literature (a journal article) with some albedo values for your land cover type
#. Note features of the paper structure: figure/table captions, multiple figures, text structure, referencing etc.
#. Prepare table(s) on instrumentation and measurements at your site (see :ref:`Activity after URAO visit <after_visit>`)
