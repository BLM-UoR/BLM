Common Mistakes: things to check
=============================================

Figures/Tables
------------------------

* Labelling of Figures (units, axis labels)
* Figure and Table captions are complete
  (i.e. reader should be able to read them as stand-alone explanations)
* Make sure all are referred to in the text prior to their appearance
* Remember that there can be subplots to a figure
  (i.e. a caption with (a), (b), (c), etc.).
* Figure (not figure)
* Figure captions are not separate for individual subplots

Significant figures
------------------------

*   Make sure they are appropriate

Units
------------------------

*  There should be

        * a space between numbers and units
        * a space between dimensions

    i.e. :math:`\textrm{W m}^{-2}`
    rather than :math:`\textrm{W/m}^2`
    or :math:`\textrm{Wm}^{-2}`

Notation
------------------------

*  Make sure that all notation is defined
   (you could create an appendix with all terms defined,
   with units, in alphabetical order).
   If you do this, make sure you refer
   to this appendix early in the paper.

*  Subscripts and superscripts should be used correctly.
*  Make sure Greek/mathematical symbols are correct.
*  Units – space between numbers and units; space between dimensions

Writing
------------------------

*  To every extent possible, be clear and concise.

*  Make sure the paper has all the appropriate sections
   (see above), and use sub-headings.

*  The term 'data' is plural. ('Data are...', not 'Data is...'.)

*  Do not write with a “Diary” style (first this, then that, etc.)
   Typically, we do not need to say this as the order
   can be determined from the text and
   therefore can be more concise.
*  Instrument details – make certain that
   these are included (can be summarised in a Table)
   – e.g., sonic model and height
   (orientation- what direction is it pointing into the wind)

References
------------------------

*  These should be included where needed
   (e.g. as a source of a method or data used as comparison)
*  Cited appropriately
   (choose a journal format and be consistent)
*  Listed at the end
   (alphabetical order, complete and in a consistent format)
*  Web sources should be included in the reference
   list and referenced appropriately
   (e.g. last date of access)
*  In the text, list references should be cited in chronological order
*  Make sure all data are referenced (e.g. the RUAO data, AmeriFlux data eta)
*  References – et al. -If  you have more than two authors wrote a paper then in the text (not the references) **et al.** is used after the first authors lastname. Note there is a dot after al. but not after et i.e. **et al.**
