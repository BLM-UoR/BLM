Scientific paper
==============================

Your report should be **structured as a scientific paper** with the following elements:

#. Title

    *	An informative title that tells the reader what the paper is about

#. Abstract

    *	Summarise objectives, methods, results and conclusions (this is often best written last)

#. Introduction

    *	Sets the wider context of this work (make certain you cite **referred** literature)
    * 	Clearly states the aims and specific objectives

#. Methods

    Make clear:

    - Time period analysed (why that period was chosen)
    - What assumptions were made
    - Cite references for methods used
    - Key equations should be included (make certain you define symbols)
    - Include a summary table for instrumentation methods.
    - Make sure you include key details, e.g. height of sensors used in your analyses
    - Reference the code (see also :ref:`GitIn`) you have developed (this will have the detailed methods within it). Create a summary table that identifies the code you have used. This will allow a concise way of being clear what you have done.

#. Results and Discussion

    * Provide be a concise summary of results, using tables and figures together with appropriate estimates of accuracy on experimentally determined parameters and variables.
    * All figures/tables must be referred to in the text and not be repetitive.
    * Include both descriptions and explanations of the observed results (i.e. not just how, but why were fluxes changing)
    * Make sure you cite evidence to support explanations

#. Conclusions

    * Draw out the main conclusions, with reference to what is expected theoretically and what results have been reported elsewhere (e.g. in a textbook or journal papers).

#. References

    * These should be included for the papers (**journal articles**), websites (these should have the **date** when they were accessed) and textbooks (etc) your paper cites
    * List at the end (alphabetical order, follow a standard convention/format)
    * `AMS instructions <https://www.ametsoc.org/ams/index.cfm/publications/authors/journal-and-bams-authors/formatting-and-manuscript-components/references/>`_
    * `BLM instructions <http://static.springer.com/sgw/documents/1495084/application/vnd.openxmlformats-officedocument.wordprocessingml.document/Detailed_Instructions_For_Authors.docx>`_
    * We have :ref:`a list of papers for better understanding the AmeriFlux datasets <amf_paper>`

#. Appendices

    * Optional.
    * Any relevant data (other than that stored in electronic form) not presented within the main text.
